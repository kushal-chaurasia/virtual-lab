<h4>Design of Associative Cache:</h4>
<p>Cache memory is a small (in size) and very fast (zero wait state) memory which sits between the CPU and main memory.
    The notion of cache memory actually rely on the correlation properties observed in sequences of address references
    generated by CPU while executing a programm(principle of locality).When a memory request is generated, the request
    is first presented to the cache memory, and if the cache cannot respond, the request is then presented to main
    memory.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Hit</strong>a cache access finds data resident in the cache memory</li>
    <li><strong>Miss</strong> a cache access does not find data resident, so it forces to access the main memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cache treats main memory as a set of blocks.As the cache size is much smaller than main memory so the number of cache
    lines are very less than the number of main memory blocks. So a procedure is needed for mapping main memory blocks
    into cache lines.cache mapping scheme affects cost and performance. There are three methods in block placement-</p>

<ul>
    <li>Direct Mapped Cache</li>
    <li>Fully Associative Mapped Cache</li>
    <li>Set Associative Mapped Cache</li>
</ul>
<strong>Associative Cache</strong>

<p>Any main memory block can mapped into any cache line. main memory address is divided into two groups which are tags
    and word bits. Words are low-order bits and identifies the location of a word within a block and tags are high-order
    bits which identifies the block.</p>

<p>If a miss occur CPU bring the block from the main memory to the cache, if there is no free block in the corresponding
    set it replaces a block and put the new one. CPU uses different replacement policies to decide which block is to
    replace. The disadvantage of the associative cache is its high cost for implementing parallel tag comparison, but
    suffer the most from thrashing due to the 'conflict misses' giving more miss penalty.</p>

<strong>Design issues:</strong>

<p><strong>Recommended learning activities for the experiment</strong>Leaning activities are designed in two stages, a basic stage and an advanced stage. Accomplishment of each stage can be self-evaluated through the given set of quiz questions consisting of multiple type and subjective type questions. In the basic stage, it is recommended to perform the experiment firstly, on the given encapsulated working module, secondly, on the module designed by the student, having gone through the theory, objective and procuder. By performing the experiment on the working module, students can only observe the input-output behavior. Where as, performing experiments on the designed module, students can do circuit analysis, error analysis in addition with the input-output behavior. It is recommended to perform the experiments following the given guideline to check behavior and test plans along with their own circuit analysis. Then students are recommended to move on to the advanced stage. The advanced stage includes the accomplishment of the given assignments which will provide deeper understanding of the topic with innovative circuit design experience. At any time, students can mature their knowledge base by further reading the references provided for the experiment.</p>
<strong>color configuration of wire for 5 valued logic supported by the simulator:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>if value is UNKNOWN, wire color= maroon</li>
    <li>if value is TRUE, wire color= blue</li>
    <li>if value is FALSE, wire color= black</li>
    <li>if value is HI IMPEDENCE, wire color= green</li>
    <li>if value is INVALID, wire color= orange</li>
</ul>
<strong>Test Plan:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>give some valid input initially in the cache then give such address so that hit occurs then alter the address content or the tag or valid bit to get a miss.</li>
    <li>Use Display units for checking output. Try to use minimum number of components to build. The pin configuration of the canned components are shown when mouse hovered over a component.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Procedure</h4>
<strong>Procedure to perform the experiment for associative cache on the existing component 'Associative Cache' component in the 'other components' drawer in the simulator.This simulator supports 5-valued logic.</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Click on the 'Associative Cache' component(in the 'other components' drawer in the pallet) and then click on the position of the editor window where you want to add the component(no drag and drop, simple click will serve the purpose), likewise add 15 Bit switches and 3 Bit Displays(from Display and Input drawer of the pallet,if it is not seen scroll down in the drawer)</li>
    <li>'Associative Cache' component in the 'other components' drawer in the simulator supports both writing in the cache and the cache mapping. No replacement policy has been implemented. Initially the cache is empty, user has to give inputs. the component contains 4 sets, each set has 5 bits, the left most bit is the valid bit, next 2 bits are tags, next bits are data bits, also it contains a one dimensional array of memory with 2 bit to store the memory address, user has to give this address input also.the cache reads all the data bits at a time so block offset is not required.</li>
    <li>The pin configuration of the component can be seen whenever the mouse is hovered on any canned component of the palette or press the 'show pinconfig' button. Pin numbering starts from 1 and from the bottom left corner(indicating with the circle) and increases anticlockwise.</li>
    <li>For a 'Associative Cache' component pin configuration is:
        <ul>
            <li>For a 'Associative Cache' component pin configuration is:</li>
            <li>pin-31= R/W'A(selects whether user wants to input the address or cache mapping)</li>
            <li>pin-30=A1, pin-29=A0 (these 2 pins are used to give address input). A1 is the most significant bit and A0 is the least significant bit. As we are reading the whole word at a time, the whole address will be in tag. So, A1 and A0 will be compared with the tag. A1 and A0 will select the corrsponding set.</li>
            <li>pin-28= R/W'D(selects whether user wants to input in the set of cache or cache mapping)</li>
            <li>pin-27= M1, pin-26=M0 (M1 is the most significant bit and M0 is the least significant bit). thiese two bits are used for cache write purpose, it selects the particular set of which user wants to give inputs to the valid bit, tag bits and data bits.</li>
            <li>pin-21= valid bit</li>
            <li>pin-20= T1, pin-19=T0 (T1 is the most significant bit and T0 is the least significant bit). These are tag bits.</li>
            <li>pin-18= D1, pin-17=D0 (D1 is the most significant bit and D0 is the least significant bit). These are data bits.</li>
            <li>pin-14= Hit/Miss bit(if it gives 1 then hit otherwise miss)</li>
            <li>pin-15= F1, pin-16=F0 (F1 is the most significant bit and F0 is the least significant bit). These are output data bits and will be given only when there is a hit.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Essential pin configurations for writing in the cache: S=1, R/W'A=0, R/W'D=0</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Essential pin configurations for cache mapping: S=0, R/W'A=1, R/W'D=1</strong></li>
    <li>To connect any two components select the Connection menu of Palette, and then click on the Source terminal and click on the target terminal. According to the circuit diagram connect all the components. After the connection is over click the selection tool in the pallete.</li>
    <li>See the output, Bit switches are used to give input so that you can toggle its value with a double click and see the outputs with different inputs.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Components :</h5>
<strong>To build a associative Cache with 4 bit memory address and 2 bit data address without any replacement policy, we need :</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Decoder with enable and decoder without enable</li>
    <li>Multiplexer with enable and multiplexer without enable</li>
    <li>Single bit memory elements</li>
    <li>XOR gates, NOR gates, AND gates</li>
    <li>Bit switches to give inputs</li>
    <li>Display units to check the outputs.</li>
    <li>Wires to connect.</li>
</ul>
