<h4>Design of ALU</h4>
<p>ALU or Arithmetic Logical Unit is a digital circuit to do arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction,division, multiplication and logical oparations like and, or, xor, nand, nor etc. A simple block diagram of a 4 bit ALU for operations and,or,xor and Add is shown here :</p>

<p>The 4-bit ALU block is combined using 4 1-bit ALU block</p>
<strong>Design Issues :</strong>
<p>The circuit functionality of a 1 bit ALU is shown here, depending upon the control signal S1 and S0 the circuit operates as follows: <br>

    for Control signal S1 = 0 , S0 = 0, the output is <strong>A And B</strong>,<br>
    
    for Control signal S1 = 0 , S0 = 1, the output is <strong>A Or B</strong>,<br>
    
    for Control signal S1 = 1 , S0 = 0, the output is <strong>A Xor B</strong>,<br>
    
    for Control signal S1 = 1 , S0 = 1, the output is <strong>A Add B</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended learning activities for the experiment</strong> Leaning activities are designed in two stages, a basic stage and an advanced stage. Accomplishment of each stage can be self-evaluated through the given set of quiz questions consisting of multiple type and subjective type questions. In the basic stage, it is recommended to perform the experiment firstly, on the given encapsulated working module, secondly, on the module designed by the student, having gone through the theory, objective and procuder. By performing the experiment on the working module, students can only observe the input-output behavior. Where as, performing experiments on the designed module, students can do circuit analysis, error analysis in addition with the input-output behavior. It is recommended to perform the experiments following the given guideline to check behavior and test plans along with their own circuit analysis. Then students are recommended to move on to the advanced stage. The advanced stage includes the accomplishment of the given assignments which will provide deeper understanding of the topic with innovative circuit design experience. At any time, students can mature their knowledge base by further reading the references provided for the experiment.</p>

<h4>Procedure to perform the experiment:Design of 4 bit ALU</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Start the simulator as directed.This simulator supports 5-valued logic.</li>
    <li>To design the circuit we need 4 1-bit ALU, 11 Bit switch (to give input,which will toggle its value with a double click), 5 Bit displays (for seeing output), wires.
    </li>
    <li>The pin configuration of a component is shown whenever the mouse is hovered on any canned component of the palette. Pin numbering starts from 1 and from the bottom left corner (indicating with the circle) and increases anticlockwise.
    </li>
    <li>For 1-bit ALU input A0 is in pin-9,B0 is in pin-10, C0 is in pin-11 (this is input carry), for selection of operation, S0 is in pin-12, S1 is in pin-13, output F is in pin-8 and output carry is pin-7
    </li>
    <li>Click on the 1-bit ALU component (in the Other Component drawer in the pallet) and then click on the position of the editor window where you want to add the component (no drag and drop, simple click will serve the purpose), likewise add 3 more 1-bit ALU (from the Other Component drawer in the pallet), 11 Bit switches and 5 Bit Displays (from Display and Input drawer of the pallet,if it is not seen scroll down in the drawer), 3 digital display and 1 bit Displays (from Display and Input drawer of the pallet,if it is not seen scroll down in the drawer)
    </li>
    <li>To connect any two components select the Connection menu of Palette, and then click on the Source terminal and click on the target terminal. According to the circuit diagram connect all the components. Connect the Bit switches with the inputs and Bit displays component with the outputs. After the connection is over click the selection tool in the pallete.
    </li>
    <li>See the output, in the screenshot diagram we have given the value of S1 S0=11 which will perform add operation and two number input as A0 A1 A2 A3=0010 and B0 B1 B2 B3=0100 so get output F0 F1 F2 F3=0110 as sum and 0 as carry which is indeed an add operation.you can also use many other combination of different values and check the result. The operations are implemented using the truth table for 4 bit ALU given in the theory.
    </li>
