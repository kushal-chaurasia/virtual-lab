<h4>Design of Combinational Multipliers</h4>
<p>Combinational Multipliers do multiplication of two unsigned binary numbers.Each bit of the multiplier is multiplied against the multiplicand, the product is aligned according to the position of the bit within the multiplier, and the resulting products are then summed to form the final result. Main advantage of binary multiplication is that the generation of intermediate products are simple: if the multiplier bit is a 1, the product is an appropriately shifted copy of the multiplicand; if the multiplier bit is a 0, the product is simply 0.</p>
<p>The design of a combinational multiplier to multiply two 4-bit binary number is illustrated below:</p>
<center><img src="{%static 'computerOrganisationArchitecture/exp6.png' %}" alt=""></center>
If two n-bit numbers are multiplied then the output will be less than or equals to 2n bits.
<p><strong>Some features of the multiplication scheme:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>it can be designed by unrolling the multiplier loop</li>
    <li>instead of handling the carry out of partial product summation bit,the carry out can be sent to the next bit of the next step</li>
    <li>this scheme of handling the carry is called carry save addition</li>
    <li>this scheme is more regular and modular</li>
</ul>

<strong>Examining behaviour of combinational multiplier for the working module and module designed by the student as part of the experiment (refer to the circuit diagram) <br>
    Loading data in the combinational multiplier (refer to procedure tab for further detail and experiment manual for pin numbers)</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>load the two input numbers as:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>multiplicand A (A3 A2 A1 A0): A3=1, A2=1, A1=0, A0=0</li>

    <P><STrong>Recommended learning activities for the experiment</STrong>Leaning activities are designed in two stages, a basic stage and an advanced stage. Accomplishment of each stage can be self-evaluated through the given set of quiz questions consisting of multiple type and subjective type questions. In the basic stage, it is recommended to perform the experiment firstly, on the given encapsulated working module, secondly, on the module designed by the student, having gone through the theory, objective and procuder. By performing the experiment on the working module, students can only observe the input-output behavior. Where as, performing experiments on the designed module, students can do circuit analysis, error analysis in addition with the input-output behavior. It is recommended to perform the experiments following the given guideline to check behavior and test plans along with their own circuit analysis. Then students are recommended to move on to the advanced stage. The advanced stage includes the accomplishment of the given assignments which will provide deeper understanding of the topic with innovative circuit design experience. At any time, students can mature their knowledge base by further reading the references provided for the experiment.</P>

    <li>For half adder input is in pin-5,8 output sum is in pin-4 and carry is pin-1, For full adder input is in pin-5,6,8 output sum is in pin-4 and carry is in pin-1</li>
    <li>Click on the half adder component (in the Adder drawer in the pallet) and then click on the position of the editor window where you want to add the component (no drag and drop, simple click will serve the purpose), likewise add 3 more half adders, 8 full adders (from the Adder drawer in the pallet), 16 AND gates (from Logic Gates drawer of the pallet,if it is not seen scroll down in the drawer), 8 Bit switches, 8 bit Displays (from Display and Input drawer of the pallet,if it is not seen scroll down in the drawer)</li>
    <li>To connect any two components select the Connection menu of Palette, and then click on the Source terminal and click on the target terminal. According to the circuit diagram connect all the components, connect bit switches to the input terminals. connect the output terminals to the Bit display component. After the connection is over click the selection tool in the pallete.</li>
    <li>See the output, bit switches are used to give input so that you can toggle its value with a double click and see the outputs with different inputs.</li>
