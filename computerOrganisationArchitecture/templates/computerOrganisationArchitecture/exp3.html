<h4>Design of Wallace Tree Adders</h4>
<p>
    There are many cases where it is desired to add more than two numbers together. The straightforward way of adding together m numbers (all n bits wide) is to add the first two, then add that sum to the next using cascading full adders. This requires a total of m − 1 additions, for a total gate delay of O(m lg n) (assuming lookahead carry adders). Instead, a tree of adders can be formed, taking only O(lg m · lg n) gate delays. <br>
    
    A Wallace tree adder adds together n bits to produce a sum of log2n bits. </p>
    
   <p> The design of a Wallace tree adder to add seven bits (W7) is illustrated below:</p>

<p><strong>Recommended learning activities for the experiment:</strong> Leaning activities are designed in two stages, a basic stage and an advanced stage. Accomplishment of each stage can be self-evaluated through the given set of quiz questions consisting of multiple type and subjective type questions. In the basic stage, it is recommended to perform the experiment firstly, on the given encapsulated working module, secondly, on the module designed by the student, having gone through the theory, objective and procuder. By performing the experiment on the working module, students can only observe the input-output behavior. Where as, performing experiments on the designed module, students can do circuit analysis, error analysis in addition with the input-output behavior. It is recommended to perform the experiments following the given guideline to check behavior and test plans along with their own circuit analysis. Then students are recommended to move on to the advanced stage. The advanced stage includes the accomplishment of the given assignments which will provide deeper understanding of the topic with innovative circuit design experience. At any time, students can mature their knowledge base by further reading the references provided for the experiment.</p>
