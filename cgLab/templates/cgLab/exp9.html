<center><H4>Clipping : Polygon</H4></center>
<p>When a 2D image is displayed onto a display screen, often the display area occupies a fraction of the amount of space that covers the entire image area. Thus the unnecessary parts of the image that are located outside the display area can be removed to reduce the exorbitant amount of computations involved to render them. This technique to remove such inessential parts of a scene lying outside the display area is called clipping. The display area is also called the clipped window.</p>
<p>The technique used to cut/clip the parts of the polygon belonging in the region, outside of the clipped window, is called polygon clipping.</p>
<p>Some common algorithms to perform polygon clipping are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sutherland-Hodgeman algorithm </li>
    <li>Wiler-Atherton algorithm </li>
</ul>

<h4>Sutherland Hodgeman's Polygon Clipping Algorithm</h4> <br>
<strong>Pseudo Code of the algorithm</strong>
<p>Input : Vertices of the polygon, (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) ∀i = {1, 2, ..., n} for n vertices in the polygon and the coordinates of the opposite corners of the clipped window.</p>
<h5>Steps of the Algorithm</h5>
<div style="border: 1px solid black;">
<pre>
    for each of the four boundaries of the clipped window
        for <sub>i+1</sub>or each edge eiin the polygon

		P<sub>i</sub> = (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) & P<sub>i+1</sub> = (x<sub>i+1</sub>, y<sub>i+1</sub>) represent the two vertices of edge ei.

		if P<sub>i</sub> & P<sub>i+1</sub> both lie outside the clipping area

			then no point is written

		else if P<sub>i</sub> & P<sub>i+1</sub> both lie inside the clipping area

			then P<sub>i</sub> is written into the points of clipped polygon

		else if P<sub>i</sub> is inside and P<sub>i+1</sub> is outside

                    then P<sub>i</sub> is written into the points of clipped polygon and we calculate the intersection of ei with the concerned boundary
                    and the point of intersection is written into the points of clipped polygon.

		else
                    then P<sub>i+1</sub> is written into the points of clipped polygon and we calculate the intersection of ei with the concerned boundary
                    and the point of intersection is written into the points of clipped polygon.

<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>Objective of this experiment is to understand the steps of a Polygon Clipping Algorithm, i.e., how a polygon is clipped so as to render only the part which a user can view. As an example, we have demonstrated the steps of Sutherland Hodgeman Algorithm.</p>
<h4>Manual</h4>
<ul>
    <li> The experiment contains a clipping window which represents the screen to which the graphics primitives (polygon in this case) are clipped to. </li>
 <li>The experiment allows the user to change the size of the clipping window. </li>
 <li>The experiment allows the user to choose the vertices of the polygon. In this experiment we can fill different kinds of polygon like convex and concave polygons in the rectangular (convex) clipping windows. </li>
 <li>At each step of the algorithm, the important computations that took place in that step are also given for better understanding of the algorithm. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Procedure</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Fix the clipping window (the default parameters are already filled in the input boxes) and then click on Enter. <br>
        You can also proceed directly to the experiment using the default parameters of the clipping window and the vertices of a polygon, by clicking on <b> Start Experiment with Default Values.</b></li>
    <li>Enter the vertices of the polygon in the input box. <br>
        Let, (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>), (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>), (x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>), (x<sub>4</sub>, y<sub>4</sub>), (x<sub>5</sub>, y<sub>5</sub>) <br>
        represent the vertices of the polygon in order, i.e., the 1<sup>st</sup> vertex is connected to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> to the 3<sup>rd</sup> and so on. The last vertex is connected to the 1<sup>st</sup> to complete the polygon. <br>
        The default vertices are already filled in the input boxes. Once you have finalized the coordinates, you can click on Start Experiment to begin with the experiment. <br>
        You can also go Back to change the values of the frame buffer.
    </li>
    <li>Throughout the experiment, you can click on Next Iteration to go to the next step of the algorithm.</li>
    <li>Once the experiment ends, you can again experiment with a new set of vertices of the polygon.</li>
</ul>
