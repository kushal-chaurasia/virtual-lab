<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>A visual representation of flow of control within a program may help the developer to perform static analysis of his
    code. One could break down his program into multiple basic blocks, and connect them with directed edges to draw a
    Control Flow Graph (CFG). A CFG of a program helps in identifying how complex a program is. It also helps to
    estimate the maximum number of test cases one might require to test the code.</p>
<p>In this experiment, we will learn about basic blocks and how to draw a CFG using them. We would look into paths and
    linearly independent paths in context of a CFG. Finally, we would learn about McCabe's cyclomatic complexity, and
    classify a given program based on that.</p>

<h4>Objective</h4>
<strong>After completing this experiment you will be able to:</strong>
<ul>
    <li> Identify basic blocks in a program module, and draw it's control flow graph (CFG) </li>
    <li> Identify the linearly independent paths from a CFG </li>
    <li> Determine Cyclomatic complexity of a module in a program </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>Control Flow Graph</h4>
<p>A control flow graph (CFG) is a directed graph where the nodes represent different instructions of a program, and the
    edges define the sequence of execution of such instructions. Figure 1 shows a small snippet of code (compute the
    square of an integer) along with it's CFG. For simplicity, each node in the CFG has been labeled with the line
    numbers of the program containing the instructions. A directed edge from node #1 to node #2 in figure 1 implies that
    after execution of the first statement, the control of execution is transferred to the second instruction.</p>

<p>A program, however, doesn't always consist of only sequential statements. There could be branching and looping
    involved in it as well. Figure 2 shows how a CFG would look like if there are sequential, selection and iteration
    kind of statements in order.</p>
<center><img src="{% static 'seLab/t1_2_cfg_types.png'%}" alt=""></center>
<center>Figure 2: CFG for different types of statements</center>
<p>A real life application seldom could be written in a few lines. In fact, it might consist of thousand of lines. A CFG
    for such a program is likely to become very large, and it would contain mostly straight-line connections. To
    simplify such a graph different sequential statements could be grouped together to form a basic block. A basic block
    is a [ii, iii] maximal sequence of program instructions I1, I2, ..., In such that for any two adjacent instructions
    Ik and Ik+1, the following holds true:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Ik is executed immediately before Ik+1 </li>
    <li> Ik+1 is executed immediately after Ik </li>
</ul>
<p>The size of a CFG could be reduced by representing each basic block with a node. To illustrate this, let's consider
    the following example.</p>
<pre>    sum = 0;
    i = 1;
    while (i ≤ n) {
        sum += i;
        ++i;
    }
    printf("%d", sum);
    if (sum > 0) {
        printf("Positive");
    }</pre>
<p>The CFG with basic blocks is shown for the above code in figure 3</p>
<center><img src="{% static 'seLab/cfg_basic_blocks.png'%}" alt=""></center>
<center>Figure 3: Basic blocks in a CFG</center>
<p>The first statement of a basic block is termed as leader. Any node x in a CFG is said to dominate another node y
    (written as x dom y) if all possible execution paths that goes through node y must pass through node x. The node x
    is said to be a dominator [ii]. In the above example, line #s 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 are leaders. The node containing
    lines 7, 8 dominate the node containing line # 10. The block containing line #s 1, 2 is said to be the entry block;
    the block containing line # 10 is said to be the exit block.</p>
<p>If any block (or sub-graph) in a CFG is not connected with the sub-graph containing the entry block, that signifies
    the concerned block contains code, which is unreachable while the program is executed. Such unreachable code can be
    safely removed from the program. To illustrate this, let's consider a modified version of our previous code:</p>
<pre>    sum = 0;
    i = 1;
    while (i ≤ n) {
        sum += i;
        ++i;
    }
    return sum;
    if (sum < 0) {
        return 0;
    }</pre>
<p>Figure 4 shows the corresponding CFG. The sub-graph containing line #s 8, 9, 10 is disconnected from the graph
    containing the entry block. The code in the disconnected sub-graph would never get executed, and, therefore, could
    be discarded.</p>

<h4>Terminologies</h4>
<strong>Path</strong>
<p>A path in a CFG is a sequence of nodes and edges that starts from the initial node (or entry block) and ends at the
    terminal node. The CFG of a program could have more than one terminal nodes.</p>
<strong>Linearly Independent Path</strong>
<p>A linearly independent path is any path in the CFG of a program such that it includes at least one new edge not
    present in any other linearly independent path. A set of linearly independent paths give a clear picture of all
    possible paths that a program can take during it's execution. Therefore, path-coverage testing of a program would
    suffice by considering only the linearly independent paths.
    In figure 3 we can find four linearly independent paths:</p>
<pre>    1 - 3 - 6 - (7, 8) - 10
    1 - 3 - 6 - (7, 8) - 9 - 10
    1 - 3 - (4, 5) - 6 - (7, 8) - 10
    1 - 3 - (4, 5) - 6 - (7, 8) - 9 - 10</pre>
<p>Note that 1 - 3 - (4, 5) - 3 - (4, 5) - 6 - (7, 8) - 10, for instance, won't qualify as a linearly independent path
    because there is no new edge not already present in any of the above four linearly independent paths</p>
<h4>McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity</h4>
<p>McCabe had applied graph-theoretic analysis to determine the complexity of a program module [vi]. Cyclomatic
    complexity metric, as proposed by McCabe, provides an upper bound for the number of linearly independent paths that
    could exist through a given program module. Complexity of a module increases as the number of such paths in the
    module increase. Thus, if Cyclomatic complexity of any program module is 7, there could be up to seven linearly
    independent paths in the module. For a complete testing, each of those possible paths should be tested.</p>
<strong>Computing Cyclomatic Complexity</strong>
<p>Let G be a a given CFG. Let E denote the number of edges, and N denote the number of nodes. Let V(G) denote the
    Cyclomatic complexity for the CFG. V(G) can be obtained in either of the following three ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Method #1:</strong>
        <center>V(G) = E - N + 2</center>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Method #2:</strong>V(G) could be directly computed by a visual inspection of the CFG:
        <center>V(G) = Total number of bounded areas + 1</center> It may be noted here that structured programming would
        always lead to a planar CFG.</li>
    <li><strong>Method #3: </strong>If LN be the total number of loops and decision statements in a program, then
        <center>V(G) = LN + 1</center>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In case of object-oriented programming, the above equations apply to methods of a class . Also, the value of V(G) so
    obtained is incremented by 1 considering the entry point of the method. A quick summary of how different types of
    statements affect V(G) could be found in . Once the complexities of individual modules of a program are known,
    complexity of the program (or class) could be determined by :</p>
<center>V(G) = SUM( V(Gi) ) - COUNT( V(Gi) ) + 1</center>
where COUNT( V(Gi) ) gives the total number of procedures (methods) in the program (class).
<h4>Optimum Value of Cyclomatic Complexity</h4>
<p>A set of threshold values for Cyclomatic complexity has been presented in, which we reproduce below.</p>
<center><img src="{% static 'seLab/exp18.png'%}" alt=""></center>
<p>It has been suggested that the Cyclomatic complexity of any module should not exceed 10 . Doing so would make a
    module difficult to understand for humans. If any module is found to have Cyclomatic complexity greater than 10, the
    module should be considered for redesign. Note that, a high value of V(G) is possible for a given module if it
    contains multiple cases in C like switch-case statements. McCabe had exempted such modules from the limit of V(G) as
    10</p>
<h4>Merits</h4>
<p>McCabe's Cyclomatic complexity has certain advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Independent of programming language </li>
    <li> Helps in risk analysis during development or maintenance phase </li>
    <li> Gives an idea about the maximum number of test cases to be executed (hence, the required effort) for a given
        module </li>
</ul>
<h4>Demerits</h4>
<p>Cyclomatic complexity doesn't reflect on cohesion and coupling of modules. </p>

<p> McCabe's Cyclomatic complexity was originally proposed for procedural languages. One may look in [xi] to get an idea
    of how the complexity calculation could be modified for object-oriented languages. In fact, one may also wish to
    make use of Chidamber-Kemerer metrics [x] (or any other similar metric), which has been designed for object-oriented
    programming.</p>

<h4>Case study</h4>
<hr>
<strong># 1 : A Library Information System for SE VLabs Institute</strong>
<hr>
<p>The SE VLabs Institute has been recently setup to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the field of
    Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also includes quite a large number
    of employees who work on different projects undertaken by the institution.</p>
<p>As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to develop a Library
    Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the institute. LIS will enable the members to
    borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend
    the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this
    system aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has administrative privileges and
    complete control over the system, can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased, or
    remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search
    books online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.</p>
<p>The final deliverable would a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should run only within the institute
    LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a large extent, care should be taken no confidential
    information (eg., passwords) is stored in plain text.</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>Let us determine the Cyclomatic complexity for the "ReissueBook" method as shown below:</p>
<pre>
    public ID ReissueBook(ID userID, ID bookID) {
        Member user = Member.GetMember(userID);
        ID transactionID = null;
        if ( user.canIssueNow() && Book.IsAvailable(bookID) ) {        
            Integer count = user.getReissueCountFor(bookID);    // # of times this books has been reissued after it's recent issue by the user
            if ( count < REISSUE_LIMIT ) {        
                user.incrementReissueCount(bookID);
                BookTransaction transaction = new BookTransaction(userID, bookID);        
                transaction.save();
                transactionID = transaction.getID();
            }
        }
        return transactionID;
    }
</pre>
<p>The Control Flow Graph for the above module is shown in figure 1. The CFG has six nodes and seven edges. So, the
    Cyclomatic complexity is V(G) = 7 - 6 + 2 = 3. It can be verified with the other two formulae as well: # of regions
    + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3. Also, # of decision points = 2. So, V(G) = 2 + 1 = 3. However, as mentioned in the theory section,
    for methods of classes we add an extra 1 to the V(G). So, the Cyclomatic complexity of this method becomes 4, which
    is good.</p>
<center><img src="{% static 'seLab/reissue_book.png'%}" alt=""></center>
<center>Figure 1. CFG for "ReissueBook" method</center>
<p>Note that in line # 3 two decisions have been short-circuited. Taking this into account, V(G) for the module would
    become 5, which is OK. This implies that the method could have upto five linearly independent paths. By looking at
    figure 1 we can easily identify three such paths. However, as mentioned that line # 3 consists of two decision
    points, that results in another "implicit" path. Based on these, we can design four test cases that would result in
    Boolean values for this sequence { user.canIssueNow, Book.IsAvailable, count < REISSUE_LIMIT }. The four such cases
        are shown below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> { true, true, true } : Output should be a valid ID </li>
            <li> { false, true, true } : Output would be null </li>
            <li> { true, false, true } : Output would be null </li>
            <li> { true, true, false } : Output would be null </li>
        </ul>

<p>Now let us focus on the "IssueManager" class. For simplicity, let's assume it has only two methods: IssueBook and ReissueBook, as shown below.</p>

<pre>
    public Class IssueManager {
        public ID IssueBook(ID userID, ID bookID) {
            Member user = Member.GetMember(userID);
            ID transactionID = null;
            if ( user.canIssueNow() && Book.IsAvailable(bookID) ) {
                Book.SetStatusIssued(bookID);
                user.incrementIssueCount(bookID);
                BookTransaction transaction = new BookTransaction(userID, bookID);        
                transaction.save();
                transactionID = transaction.getID();
            }
            return transactionID;
        }
    
        public ID ReissueBook(ID userID, ID bookID) {
            Member user = Member.GetMember(userID);
            ID transactionID = null;
            if ( user.canIssueNow() && Book.IsAvailable(bookID) ) {        
            Integer count = user.getReissueCountFor(bookID);    // # of times this books has been reissued after it's recent issue by the user
                if ( count &lt; REISSUE_LIMIT ) {        
                    user.incrementReissueCount(bookID);
                    BookTransaction transaction = new BookTransaction(userID, bookID);        
                    transaction.save();
                    transactionID = transaction.getID();
                }
            }
            return transactionID;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>"IssueBook" has two decision points (if and &&). So, V(GIssueBook) = (2 + 1) + 1 = 4. We have already determined V(GReissueBook) to be 5. So, the total Cyclomatic complexity of this class (having two methods) becomes</p>
<center>V(G) = (4 + 5) - 2 + 1 = 8</center>
