<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Classes are the structural units in object oriented system design approach, so it is essential to know all the
    relationships that exist between the classes, in a system. All objects in a system are also interacting to each
    other by means of passing messages from one object to another. Sequence diagram shows these interactions with time
    ordering of the messages.</p>
<p>In this Experiment, we will learn about the representation of class diagram and sequence diagram. We also learn about
    different relationships that exist among the classes, in a system.</p>
<p>From the experiment of sequence diagram, we will learn about different types of messages passing in between the
    objects and time ordering of those messages, in a system.</p>

<h4>Objectives</h4>
<strong>After completing this experiment you will be able to:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Graphically represent a class, and associations among different classes</li>
    <li>Identify the logical sequence of activities undergoing in a system, and represent them pictorially</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>Structural and Behavioral aspects</h4>
<p>Developing a software system in object oriented approach is very much dependent on understanding the problem. Some
    aspects and the respective models are used to describe problems and in context of those aspects the respective
    models give a clear idea regarding the problem to a designer. For developer, structural and behavioral aspects are
    two key aspects to see through a problem to design a solution for the same.</p>
<h4>Class diagram</h4>
<p>It is a graphical representation for describing a system in context of its static construction</p>
<h4>Elements in class diagram</h4>
<p>Class diagram contains the system classes with its data members, operations and relationships between classes.</p>
<h4>Class</h4>
<p>A set of objects containing similar data members and member functions is described by a class. In UML syntax, class
    is identified by solid outline rectangle with three compartments which contain</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Classs Name: </strong>A class is uniquely identified in a system by its name. A textual string [2]is
        taken as class name. It lies in the first compartment in class rectangle.</li>
    <li><strong>Attribute: </strong>Property shared by all instances of a class. It lies in the second compartment in
        class rectangle.</li>
    <li><strong>Operation: </strong> An execution of an action can be performed for any object of a class. It lies in
        the last compartment in class rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Example</strong>
<p>To build a structural model for an Educational Organization, ‘Course’ can be treated as a class which contains
    attributes ‘courseName’ & ‘courseID’ with the operations ‘addCourse()’ & ‘removeCourse()’ allowed to be performed
    for any object to that class.</p>
<center><img src="{% static 'seLab/exp71.jpg'%}" alt=""></center>
<center>Figure-01:</center>
<strong>Generalization/Specialization</strong>
<p>It describes how one class is derived from another class. Derived class inherits the properties of its parent class.
</p>
<strong>Example</strong>
<center><img src="{% static 'seLab/exp72.jpg'%}" alt=""></center>
<center>Figure-02:</center>
<p>Geometric_Shapes is the class that describes how many sides a particular shape has. Triangle, Quadrilateral and
    Pentagon are the classes that inherit the property of the Geometric_Shapes class. So the relations among these
    classes are generalization. Now Equilateral_Triangle, Isosceles_Triangle and Scalene_Triangle, all these three
    classes inherit the properties of Triangle class as each one of them has three sides. So, these are specialization
    of Triangle class.</p>
<h4>Relationships</h4>
<p>Existing relationships in a system describe legitimate connections between the classes in that system.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>associations</strong>
        <p>It is an instance level relationship[i] that allows exchanging messages among the objects of both ends of
            association. A simple straight line connecting two class boxes represent an association. We can give a name
            to association and also at the both end we may indicate role names and multiplicity of the adjacent classes.
            Association may be uni-directional.</p>
        <strong>Example</strong>
        <p>In structure model for a system of an organization an employee (instance of ‘Employee’ class) is always
            assigned to a particular department (instance of ‘Department’ class) and the association can be shown by a
            line connecting the respective classes.</p>
        <center><img src="{% static 'seLab/exp73.jpg'%}" alt=""></center>
        <center>Figure-03:</center>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Aggregation</strong>
        <p>It is a special form of association which describes a part-whole[i] relationship between a pair of classes.
            It means, in a relationship, when a class holds some instances of related class, then that relationship can
            be designed as an aggregation.</p>
        <strong>Example</strong>
        <p>For a supermarket in a city, each branch runs some of the departments they have. So, the relation among the
            classes ‘Branch’ and ‘Department’ can be designed as an aggregation. In UML, it can be shown as in the fig.
            below</p>
        <center><img src="{% static 'seLab/exp74.jpg'%}" alt=""></center>
        <center>Figure-04:</center>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Composition</strong>
        <p>It is a strong from of aggregation which describes that whole is completely owns its part. Life cycle of the
            part depends on the whole.</p>
        <strong>Example</strong>
        <p>Let consider a shopping mall has several branches in different locations in a city. The existence of branches
            completely depends on the shopping mall as if it is not exist any branch of it will no longer exists in the
            city. This relation can be described as composition and can be shown as below</p>
        <center><img src="{% static 'seLab/exp75.jpg'%}" alt=""></center>
        <center>Figure-05:</center>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Multipplicity</strong>
        <p>It describes how many numbers of instances of one class is related to the number of instances of another
            class in an association</p>
        <strong>Notation for different types of multiplicity:</strong>
        <center><img src="{% static 'seLab/exp77.png'%}" alt=""></center>
        <center>Figure-06:</center>
        <strong>Example</strong>
        <p>One vehicle may have two or more wheels</p>
        <center><img src="{% static 'seLab/exp76.jpg'%}" alt=""></center>
        <center>Figure-07:</center>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Sequence Diagram</h4>
<p>It represents the behavioral aspects of a system. Sequence diagram shows the interactions between the objects[1] by
    means of passing messages from one object to another with respect to time in a system.</p>
<h4>Elimination in sequence diagram</h4>
<p>Sequence diagram contains the objects of a system and their life-line bar and the messages passing between them.</p>
<h4>Object</h4>
<p>Objects appear at the top portion of sequence diagram[1]. Object is shown in a rectangle box. Name of object precedes
    a colon ‘:’ and the class name, from which the object is instantiated. The whole string is underlined and appears in
    a rectangle box. Also, we may use only class name or only instance name.</p>
<p>Objects which are created at the time of execution of use case and are involved in message passing , are appear in
    diagram, at the point of their creation</p>
<h4>Life-line bar</h4>
<p>A down-ward vertical line from object-box is shown as the life-line of the object. A rectangle bar on life-line
    indicates that it is active at that point of time</p>
<h4>Message</h4>
Messages are shown as an arrow from the life-line of sender object to the life-line of receiver object and labeled with
the message name. Chronological order of the messages passing throughout the objects’ life-line show the sequence in
which they occur[1] . There may exist some different types of messages
<ul>
    <li> <strong> Synchronous messages:</strong>Receiver start processing the message after receiving it and sender
        needs to wait until it is
        made[iii]. A straight arrow with close and fill arrow-head from sender life-line bar to receiver end, represent
        a
        synchronous message.</li>
    <li> <strong> Asynchronous messages:</strong>For asynchronous message sender needs not to wait for the receiver to
        process the message[iv].
        A function call that creates thread can be represented as an asynchronous message in sequence diagram[iv]. A
        straight arrow with open arrow-head from sender life-line bar to receiver end, represent an asynchronous
        message.</li>
    <li> <strong> Return message:</strong>For a function call when we need to return a value to the object, from which
        it was called, then we
        use return message. But, it is optional, and we are using it when we are going to model our system in much
        detail. A
        dashed arrow with open arrow-head from sender life-line bar to receiver end, represent that message.</li>
    <li> <strong> Response message:</strong>One object can send a message to self[iv]. We use this message when we need
        to show the interaction
        between the same object.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Simplified class diagram and sequence diagram of a web browser.</h4>
<p>A web browser is a software that helps to access a resource (web page) available on the World Wide Web and identified
    by a URL. Whenever a user types in the URL of a web page in the browser's address bar and clicks the "Go" button,
    the browser sends a HTTP request to the concerned web server. If the requested resource is available and accessible,
    the web server sends back a HTTP response to the requesting web browser. In case of any error, a HTTP response is
    sent indicating the error.</p>
<p>When the web browser receives a HTTP response, it displays the web page to the user. In very simple terms a web
    browser can be thought of consisting the following sub-components: rendering engine, and browser control.</p>
<p>Once a HTTP response has been obtained from the server, the rendering engine decides the layout of the contents and
    actually displays the requested page. This is done keeping in mind the different HTML elements that are present in
    the page, and corresponding CSS rules, if any.</p>
<p>The browser control provides facilities like navigating across pages (by following hyperlinks), reload a page, and
    handles other events related to the window display, for example, resizing the browser window./p>

<h4>Case study</h4>

<strong># 1 : A Library Information System for SE VLabs Institute</strong>
<hr>
<p>The SE VLabs Institute has been recently setup to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the field of
    Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also includes quite a large number
    of employees who work on different projects undertaken by the institution.</p>
<p>As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to develop a Library
    Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the institute. LIS will enable the members to
    borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend
    the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this
    system aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has administrative privileges and
    complete control over the system, can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased, or
    remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search
    books online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.</p>
<p>The final deliverable would a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should run only within the institute
    LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a large extent, care should be taken no confidential
    information (eg., passwords) is stored in plain text.</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>Let us consider the "Issue Book" use case and represent the involved steps in a sequence diagram as shown in figure
    1. We assume that the book to be issued is available. An user makes a request to issue a book against his account.
    This is shown by the "issueBook(bookID)" call from "Member" to "IssueManager" objects. At this point the system
    checks whether that particular user can issue another book (based on the maximum number of books that he can issue)
    by invoking the "canIssue()" method on the "Member". As a result of this call, a response ("status") is sent back to
    the "IssueManager" class. If the "status" is "true" (as indicated in the note), status of the concerned book is set
    to "issued". A new transaction is saved corresponding to the current issue of book by the user. Finally, a success
    message is sent back to "Member" indicating that the book was successfully issued.</p>
<center><img src="{% static 'seLab/seq_issue_book.png'%}" alt=""></center>
<center>Figure-01:</center>
<p>Few points could be noted here. Notes can be used almost anywhere within an UML diagram for whatever purpose. In
    figure 1 we use a note to specify the condition when status of a book is set to 'issued'. UML 1.0 had used guard
    conditions to specify such kind of Boolean logic. UML 2.0 provide components to specify the alternate scenarios
    within a sequence diagram (not discussed here). One can definitely make use of these components. However, if the
    number of IF-THEN-ELSE conditions in a sequence diagram becomes high, the diagram gets complicated. In such cases
    one can draw multiple sequence diagrams for alternate conditions.</p>
<p>One key component in figure 1 is the "IssueManager" class. This class doesn't represent the actual Library
    Information System (LIS). Rather, this is a part of LIS -- a specific module to handle issuing of books to the
    members.</p>
<p>Also, note that the life cycle of the "Transactions" has been shown as self-destroyed. To understand this, consider
    how a transaction is actually implemented in code. One creates an object from "Transactions" class, fills it up with
    all necessary information, and then saves the transaction. Thereafter, the transaction object is not required to be
    in memory.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the order of steps involved in the process of purchasing of a new book. In this case also,
    "PurchaseManager" is a part of LIS, which manages all books that are being purchased. The activation bars indicate
    the different instances when a particular object is active in their corresponding life cycles.</p>
<center><img src="{% static 'seLab/seq_purchase_books.png'%}" alt=""></center>
<center>Figure 2: Sequence diagram for "Purchase Books"</center>
<P>One may have doubts over the inclusion of "Distributor" class. "Distributor" is not a constituent of the LIS;
    however, it interacts with LIS. Here "Distributor" is meant to represent the "interface" between LIS and the actual,
    physical book sellers and distributors. For instance, LIS can store details of distributor XYZ, including it's email
    address, bank account number, into it's records. Whenever the librarian places a new order to XYZ, the order is
    being sent electronically to XYZ, processed (possibly with a delay), a corresponding invoice is generated, and sent
    back to LIS. "placeOrder(orderID)" has been indicated as asynchronous calls since the calling object can continue
    with other tasks. The books would be dispatched by XYZ physically, which lies outside the boundary of LIS. Once the
    ordered books have been received, the librarian opts to make payment for his orders, which, too, could happen
    electronically through Net Banking. Technology has, indeed, made a huge progress!</P>
<p>Finally, at his leisure time, the librarian might consider updating the inventory according to the corresponding
    order.</p>
<p>Classes are the fundamental components of any object oriented design and development. Unless individual class, it's
    attributes and associated operations have been modeled well, a lot of suffereing could await during the development
    phase. However, unlike waterfall model, the life cycle in object oriented development is iterative. One builds a
    model, analyze it's efficiency, and refines it thereafter, if required. Therefore, an analyst, designer, or
    developer doesn't have the tight constraints to create a perfect art at one go.</p>
<p>Based on conceptual modeling and domain knowledge we already had identified a list of classes. We present them here
    once again:</p>
<ul>
   <li> Member </li>
   <li> Book </li>
   <li> Transaction (of books) </li>
   <li> Librarian </li>
   <li> Employee </li>
   <li> Book Inventory </li>
   <li> Distributor </li>
   <li> Order </li>
   <li> Order Line Item </li>
   <li> Payment </li>
   <li> Invoice </li>
</ul>
<p>Let's focus on the "Member", "Librarian" and "Employee" classes. The "Employee" class could be considered as a parent class, some of whose properties are inherited by the "Member" class. Again, "Librarian" is just a special type of "Member" with certain extra privileges. However, it may be noted here that LIS in no way would be interested to know about employees who are not members of LIS. Moreover, to distinguish between a normal member and a librarian, one could define a set of roles, and assign them appropriately to the members. This approach provides a flexible approach to manage users. For example, if the librarian goes on a leave, another member could be assigned the librarian role temporarily. Therefore, we decide to have a single "Member" class, whose instances could have one or more roles. This is shown in figure 3 with the "association" relationship between "Member" and "Role" classes. The "Role" class could consist of a list of available roles. A list could be maintained in the "Member" class to indicate which roles are associated with a particular instance of it.</p>
<center><img style="width: 90%;" src="{% static 'seLab/class_1.png'%}" alt=""></center>
<p>The "LIS" class consists of several modules: "RegistrationManager", "IssueManager" "ReturnManager", and "PurchaseManager". Their "composition" relationship with "LIS" indicates that any of these individual modules wouldn't exist without the existence of "LIS". The "IssueManager" class is responsible for issue and reissue of books while considering the two-times reissue constraint placed on a book.</p>
<p>The relation between "IssueManager" class and "Book" class is shown as "weak dependency". This is due to the reason that the "IssueManager" class do not require a "Book" as it's member variable. Rather, when an user has issued a book, the concerned method in "IssueManager" just needs to update the status of the corresponding book. No instance of "Book" needs to be created. The arrow from "IssueManager" to "Book" indicates that only the former knows about the "Book" class. The relationship between "PurchaseManager" and "Distributor" is, however, not a weak dependency. The "PurchaseManager" class has a member variable of type "Distributor", which keeps track of the distributor selected for the current purchase.</p>
<p>With the classes so identified, the code for issue book could look as follows:</p>
<pre>public ID IssueBook(ID userID, ID bookID) {
    Member user = Member.GetMember(userID);
    ID transactionID = null;
    if ( user.canIssueNow() && Book.IsAvailable(bookID) ) {
        Book.SetStatusIssued(bookID);
        user.incrementIssueCount(bookID);
        BookTransaction transaction = new BookTransaction(userID, bookID);        
        transaction.save();
        transactionID = transaction.getID();
    }
    return transactionID;
}</pre>
<p>The code for reissuing a book to an user could look like the following.</p>
<pre>public ID ReissueBook(ID userID, ID bookID) {
    Member user = Member.GetMember(userID);
    ID transactionID = null;
    if ( user.canIssueNow() && Book.IsAvailable(bookID) ) {        
        Integer count = user.getReissueCountFor(bookID);    // # of times this books has been reissued after it's recent issue by the user
        if ( count < REISSUE_LIMIT ) {        
            user.incrementReissueCount(bookID);
            BookTransaction transaction = new BookTransaction(userID, bookID);        
            transaction.save();
            transactionID = transaction.getID();
        }
    }
   </pre>
