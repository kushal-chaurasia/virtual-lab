                <h4>Computer Programming</h4>
                <p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to
                    accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks
                    such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption,
                    and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as
                    coding). The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to
                    programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit.
                    The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance
                    of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given
                    problem. Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects,
                    including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>
                <p>Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance,
                    implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of
                    computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term
                    software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or
                    coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques
                    with software development practices. Reverse engineering is the opposite process. A hacker is any
                    skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem, but it can also
                    mean a security hacker in common language.</p>

                <p>This lab is targetted toward the student in early years or we can say early stage of graduations of
                    computer science department so that they can have exposure toward the basic concepts of programming
                    in C and C++</p>
                The students who are willing to learn the concept of programming are the targeted audience no matter
                what they field they are enrolled

            <div class="content" id="div4">
                <h4>Computer programming</h4>
                In this lab the student will came across the following topics that we enhance the skills of student
                allong with will be provided by source code and a compiler to run their code. <br>
                <strong>The topics are as follows</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Numerica Approximation</strong> This experiment demonstrates the idea that one can
                        attain a perfect solution in the limit by suucessively computing approximations to the exact
                        value. The intent behind this experiment is to make use of ideas laerned in the previous
                        experiments. This is intended to introduce the student to numerical methods.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>Function</strong> enable modular decomposition of large programs. They allow reuse and
                        improve readability and maintainability of programs. When constructed properly, functions also
                        enable reasoning about their properties. A function typically receives arguments and returns a
                        value. This experiment shows function definition and invocation within a program.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Advance Control flow</strong> This experiment shows the execution of programs that use
                        for loops and while loops. It includes programs with nested for loops to illustrate complex
                        control flow within the program. The student will be able to visually comprehend the flow
                        control.
                    </li>
                    <li><Strong>Arrays</Strong> Arrays are used to store multiple data of same type. There are the most
                        efficient means to store sequential collection of values. Programs use loops to process data
                        stored in arrays. This experiment demonstrates steps involved in defining arrays, initializing
                        them and processing the data contained in the arrays.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Structures</strong> Structures are used to represent records - a logical group of
                        related items. Individual items in a structure are usually of different data types. Programming
                        languages provide unique syntactic constructs to access fields of a record. This experiment
                        demonstrates the use of structures within a program.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Basic control flow</strong> Computer programs employ control structures such as
                        conditional statements, multi-way branches and iteration. This experiment allows the student to
                        execute programs that use if-then-else statements and switch-case statements. The execution of a
                        program is animated and the intermediate results are displayed in seperate output sections for
                        better comprehension.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Pointer</strong> A pointer data type represnts addresses in program address space. In
                        the C programming language, pointers are used for efficiency and for causing side-effects. They
                        are also used for dynamic memory management within programs. This experiment demonstrates such
                        uses of pointers in C programs.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Recursion</strong>  Many data structures are self-similar at different levels. Many operations over such data are naturally expressed as operations that repetitively process diminishing parts of such data. In many cases, ieration can be naturally viwed as a function that reflexively applies itself on the data. This experiment is intended to demonstrate the use of recursion in programs.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Expression Evaluation</strong>         This experiment demostrates the automatic evaluation of expressions involving arithmetic and logical operators. Input expressions may be arbitrarily nested. The evaluation employs a stack to handle operator precedence and nesting. The evaluation steps are simple animation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
